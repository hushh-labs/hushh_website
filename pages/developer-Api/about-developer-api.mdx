## Where do we get our data from:

Wondering where we get our data from ? It’s simple- the owners are in control! Your data, your terms, and absolutely no cloud syncing without your consent.

Now let’s talk sources- the vital components that fuel the Hushh engine, right there on your device! 
Users have full authority over the data they choose to share. Data syncing to the cloud only occurs with the user’s explicit consent. Our API’s adhere to GDPR compliance standards. 

## Data Categories in Hushh:

**Category 1- User-Owned Data:**
1. User’s GMAIL 
2. Photos access (selective)
3. Folders access (selective)
4. Apple Health data
5. Financial data

**Category 2- Hushh-collected Data:**

We just don’t collect, we curate! Because it’s not just about coding; it’s about creating a future where applications are as unique as the individuals who use them.
