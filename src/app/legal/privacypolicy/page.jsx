            Hushone Health Study Apps Privacy Policy
            <br />
            <br />
            What Is Personal Data at Hushone, Inc?
            <br />
            <br />
            At Hushone, Inc, we staunchly believe in fundamental privacy rights,
            asserting that such rights should remain consistent regardless of
            geographical location. As such, we regard any data that identifies
            or can identify an individual directly or is linked or can be linked
            to them by Hushone as “personal data,” irrespective of the
            individual’s location. This encompasses data that directly
            identifies you, like your name, as well as data that might not
            directly identify you but can reasonably be used to do so, such as
            your device’s serial number. Aggregated data is treated as
            non-personal data within the scope of this Privacy Policy.
            <br />
            <br />
            This Privacy Policy governs how Hushone, Inc or any
            Hushone-affiliated company (collectively, “Hushone”) manages
            personal data, whether you engage with us via our websites, Hushone
            apps (e.g., Hushone Wallet, Browser Extension, Concierge App, ), or
            in person (including via phone or when visiting our corporate
            offices). Hushone may also link to third-party services on our
            platforms or offer third-party apps for download through our App
            Store. Hushone’s Privacy Policy does not extend to third-party
            handling of personal data. We encourage you to review their privacy
            policies to understand your rights before engaging with them.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your Privacy Rights at Hushone, Inc
            <br />
            <br />
            Hushone, Inc respects your rights to know, access, correct,
            transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data.
            We extend these rights globally to our customers, and exercising
            these rights will not result in discriminatory treatment or a
            diminished level of service from Hushone. You also have the right to
            withdraw your consent at any time where consent is the basis of
            processing your personal data by Hushone.
            <br />
            <br />
            To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including when a
            third-party service provider acts on behalf of Hushone, visit the
            Hushone Data and Privacy page at privacy@hushh.ai or for specific
            services. We ensure the security of your personal data by requiring
            sign-in to your account for identity verification. Should you need a
            copy of personal data not readily available, you can initiate a
            request at hushh.ai/legal/privacy/contact.
            <br />
            <br />
            There may be instances where we're unable to fulfill your request,
            such as if deleting transaction data contradicts our legal
            obligations to retain transaction records. We may also deny requests
            that would compromise our data use for anti-fraud and security
            purposes, jeopardize others' privacy, appear frivolous or
            impractical.
            <br />
            <br />
            For residents of California unable to access Hushone’s Data and
            Privacy page, requests can be made directly at
            hushh.ai/legal/privacy/contact or by contacting us at the provided
            support numbers.
            <br />
