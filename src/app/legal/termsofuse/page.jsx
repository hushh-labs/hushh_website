            Your Use of the Site
            <br />
            You may not use any "deep-link", "page-scrape", "robot", "spider" or
            other automatic device, program, algorithm or methodology, or any
            similar or equivalent manual process, to access, acquire, copy or
            monitor any portion of the Site or any Content, or in any way
            reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation
            of the Site or any Content, to obtain or attempt to obtain any
            materials, documents or information through any means not purposely
            made available through the Site. Hushone reserves the right to bar
            any such activity.
            <br />
            You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or
            feature of the Site, or any other systems or networks connected to
            the Site or to any Hushone server, or to any of the services offered
            on or through the Site, by hacking, password "mining" or any other
            illegitimate means.
            <br />
            You may not probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the Site or any
            network connected to the Site, nor breach the security or
            authentication measures on the Site or any network connected to the
            Site. You may not reverse look-up, trace or seek to trace any
            information on any other user of or visitor to the Site, or any
            other customer of Hushone, including any Hushone account not owned
            by you, to its source, or exploit the Site or any service or
            information made available or offered by or through the Site, in any
            way where the purpose is to reveal any information, including but
            not limited to personal identification or information, other than
            your own information, as provided for by the Site.
            <br />
            You agree that you will not take any action that imposes an
            unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure
            of the Site or Hushone’s systems or networks, or any systems or
            networks connected to the Site or to Hushone.
            <br />
            You agree not to use any device, software or routine to interfere or
            attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any
            transaction being conducted on the Site, or with any other person’s
            use of the Site.
            <br />
            You may not forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in
            order to disguise the origin of any message or transmittal you send
            to Hushone on or through the Site or any service offered on or
            through the Site. You may not pretend that you are, or that you
            represent, someone else, or impersonate any other individual or
            entity.
            <br />
            You may not use the Site or any Content for any purpose that is
            unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Use, or to solicit the
            performance of any illegal activity or other activity which
            infringes the rights of Hushone or others.
            <br />
            Purchases; Other Terms and Conditions
            <br />
            Additional terms and conditions may apply to purchases of goods or
            services and to specific portions or features of the Site, including
            contests, promotions or other similar features, all of which terms
            are made a part of these Terms of Use by this reference. You agree
            to abide by such other terms and conditions, including where
            applicable representing that you are of sufficient legal age to use
            or participate in such service or feature. If there is a conflict
            between these Terms of Use and the terms posted for or applicable to
            a specific portion of the Site or for any service offered on or
            through the Site, the latter terms shall control with respect to
            your use of that portion of the Site or the specific service.
            <br />
            Hushone’s obligations, if any, with regard to its products and
            services are governed solely by the agreements pursuant to which
            they are provided, and nothing on this Site should be construed to
            alter such agreements.
            <br />
            Hushone may make changes to any products or services offered on the
            Site, or to the applicable prices for any such products or services,
            at any time, without notice. The materials on the Site with respect
            to products and services may be out of date, and Hushone makes no
            commitment to update the materials on the Site with respect to such
            products and services.
            <br />

            and they are incorporated herein by this reference:

            Accounts, Passwords, and Security
            <br />
            Certain features or services offered on or through the Site may
            require you to open an account (including setting up a Hushh ID and
            password). You are entirely responsible for maintaining the
            confidentiality of the information you hold for your account,
            including your password, and for any and all activity that occurs
            under your account as a result of your failing to keep this
            information secure and confidential. You agree to notify Hushone
            immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or
            any other breach of security. You may be held liable for losses
            incurred by Hushone or any other user of or visitor to the Site due
            to someone else using your Hushh ID, password, or account as a
            result of your failing to keep your account information secure and
            confidential.
            <br />
            You may not use anyone else’s Hushh ID, password, or account at any
            time without the express permission and consent of the holder of
            that Hushh ID, password, or account. Hushone cannot and will not be
            liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply
            with these obligations.
            <br />
            Privacy
            <br />
            Hushone’s Privacy Policy applies and agree that Internet
            transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand
            that any message or information you send to the Site may be read or
            intercepted by others, even if there is a special notice that a
            particular transmission (for example, credit card information) is
            encrypted.
            <br />
            This Site may contain links to other independent third-party Web

            FEATURE OF THE SITE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT ANY

            ACTS, OMISSIONS AND CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH

            ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND ANY LINKED
            SITES. YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST Hushone FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE
            SITE OR ANY CONTENT IS TO STOP USING THE SITE OR ANY SUCH CONTENT.
            THIS LIMITATION OF RELIEF IS A PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE
            PARTIES.
            <br />
            The above disclaimer applies to any damages, liability or injuries
            caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption,
            deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer
            virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction of or
            unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use, whether for breach of
            contract, tort, negligence or any other cause of action.
            <br />
            Hushone reserves the right to do any of the following, at any time,
            without notice: (1) to modify, suspend or terminate operation of or
            access to the Site, or any portion of the Site, for any reason; (2)
            to modify or change the Site, or any portion of the Site, and any
            applicable policies or terms; and (3) to interrupt the operation of
            the Site, or any portion of the Site, as necessary to perform
            routine or non-routine maintenance, error correction, or other
            changes.
            <br />
            Limitation of Liability
            <br />
            Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Hushone be liable
            to you for any indirect, consequential, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL OR
            PUNITIVE DAMAGES, including lost profits, even if Hushone has been
            advised of the possibility of such damages.
            <br />
            If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use,
            Hushone is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which
            arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site
            or any Content, Hushone’s liability shall in no event exceed the
            greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar fees with
            respect to any service or feature of or on the Site paid in the six
            months prior to the date of the initial claim made against Hushone
            (but not including the purchase price for any Hushone hardware or
            software products or any HushoneCare or similar support program), or
            (2) US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of
            liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.
            <br />
            Indemnity
            <br />
            You agree to indemnify and hold Hushone, its officers, directors,
            shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees,
            agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands,
            loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees),
            made against Hushone by any third party due to or arising out of or
            in connection with your use of the Site.
            <br />
            Violation of These Terms of Use
            <br />
            Hushone may disclose any information we have about you (including
            your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in
            connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of
            the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against
            someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
            intentionally or unintentionally) Hushone’s rights or property, or
            the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site,
            including Hushone’s customers. Hushone reserves the right at all
            times to disclose any information that Hushone deems necessary to
            comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
            governmental request. Hushone also may disclose your information
            when Hushone determines that applicable law requires or permits such
            disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies
            and organizations for fraud protection purposes.
            <br />
            You acknowledge and agree that Hushone may preserve any transmittal
            or communication by you with Hushone through the Site or any service
            offered on or through the Site, and may also disclose such data if
            required to do so by law or Hushone determines that such
            preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply
            with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to
            claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4)
            protect the rights, property or personal safety of Hushone, its
            employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and the public.
            <br />
            You agree that Hushone may, in its sole discretion and without prior
            notice, terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future
            access to the Site if we determine that you have violated these
            Terms of Use or other agreements or guidelines which may be
            associated with your use of the Site. You also agree that any
            violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful
            and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to
            Hushone, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you
            consent to Hushone obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that
            Hushone deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These
            remedies are in addition to any other remedies Hushone may have at
            law or in equity.
            <br />
            You agree that Hushone may, in its sole discretion and without prior
            notice, terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes
            (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other
            government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated account
            deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Site
            or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4) unexpected
            technical issues or problems.
            <br />
            If Hushone does take any legal action against you as a result of
            your violation of these Terms of Use, Hushone will be entitled to
            recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys’
            fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief
            granted to Hushone. You agree that Hushone will not be liable to you
            or to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as
            a result of any violation of these Terms of Use.
            <br />
            Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
            <br />
            You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the
            Site, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the
            United States and by the laws of the State of Washington without
            regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. You agree to the
            personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts
            in King County, Washington, and waive any objection to such
            jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does
            not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you
            are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in
            the courts of the country where you reside. Any claim under these
            Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of
            action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims
            made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods
            and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be
            sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses,
            except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and
            attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between
            Hushone and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the
            Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to
            resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such
            dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days),
            then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to
            mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then
            the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to
            them under applicable law.

            States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide, not all features,
            products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered
            through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all
            geographic locations, or appropriate or available for use outside

            service to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature,
            product or service made on the Site is void where prohibited. If you

            <br />
            If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court
            or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or
            unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the
            minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that
            best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms
            of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use
            constitute the entire agreement between you and Hushone with regard
            to your use of the Site, and any and all other written or oral
            agreements or understandings previously existing between you and
            Hushone with respect to such use are hereby superseded and
            cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you enter
            into with Hushone, Hushone will not accept any counter-offers to
            these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically
            rejected. Hushone’s failure to insist on or enforce strict
            performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver
            by Hushone of any provision or any right it has to enforce these
            Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Hushone and
            you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these
            Terms of Use. These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or
            construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.
